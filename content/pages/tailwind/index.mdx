It's nice to meet you. I'm Michael, a programmer and consultant from Chicago.

Please consider this page as my cover letter for the staff software engineer opportunity.

A quick working intro - <br />
I've been a full-stack software engineer for nearly a decade now, working primary in the JS / TS space. I've worked at and co-founded companies in the following industries: e-commerce, e-sports, agtech, generative AI, bitcoin and crypto, higher education, and NGOs.

## A Great Fit

### _What I'm Excited About_

I'm excited about the opportunity to work with extremely talented, driven, and mission-aligned people. I've been working as a freelance contractor and consultant for the better half of two years and the positions I've held have been more lone-wolfy and less team-efforty than I had hoped for. I'm ready to be back on a team and in a supportive community.

I like all of the upcoming projects, but get excited about designing and building new Headless UI components, running Tailwind in the browser, and Rust-powered tooling.

### _Interesting Projects_

I've been an active member in the bitcoin and nostr design spaces, helping define standards and practices for user experience and application development. Connecting to Tailwind Labs in a Venn Diagram-like way, I started learning Rust in the past year as part of my bitcoin developer journey since it is used in many popular bitcoin codebases and packages.

I knew that Vercel was using it for Turbopack and other performance improvements, but I did not think much about how my exposure to the Rust language could translate outside of bitcoin in the broader developer tooling ecosystem. Its somewhat serindipitous to realize I might be able to apply that knowledge in a new way.

I am a beginner Rust developer at best and needed a lot of help and pair programming to work my way through various projects and assignments in the past, but I truly enjoy the challenge and want to keep improving.

### _Open-source Contributions_

I was previously a student and I'm now currently a member of [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com)' Bitcoin education programs. This is where I first started learning Rust, was introduced to Bitcoin Core, and began tinkering with the lightning network. I was also a contributor and participant in their recent FOSS developer program.

I am also a member of the [Yak Collective](https://www.yakcollective.org), an open-source community for collaborative tinkering. I am a facilitator and contributor to both the indie accelerator and distributed systems programs.

Most recently, I joined the [Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com), an open-source protocol study and research program. I am a contributor and researcher studying different protocols and blockchains.

Regarding recent open-source code contributions, the website you are currently reading these words on is OSS. I am also building an open-source website for a web3 web agency, which can be found [here](https://cornfed.io).

### _Previous Experience_

I have a [page](/work) listing the different projects, startups, and companies I've worked with in the recent past with links to their websites. With respect to leadership responsibilities, I was the lead developer of our first product offering at BlockEarner, led projects and teams of engineers and designers at AE Studio, and wore all the hats as a co-founder at SmartLocker.

I'll highlight SmartLocker because I learned so much so quickly from that experience. I was 1 of 3 co-founders building a meat processing order management platform.

On any given day I might've been leading a sales call with a potential customer, onboarding new customers onto the platform, working with designers, or writing, reviewing, and quality assuring our code.

### _Technical Writing_

The elephant in the room is that I don't currently have a live blog. I wrote internal technical documentation at Hy-Vee, the.com, AE Studio, and SmartLocker. However, I don't have access to that documentation anymore nor is it public. So you'll have to trust me on this one.

I've journaled since I was a teenager, but I either didn't want to or didn't feel the need to share that process or those thoughts with others. That sentiment has indeed changed and I am currently writing a couple different posts. So please stay tuned.

In the meantime, I am engaged in good old pen pal snail mail with a small group from my indie accelerator project in the Yak Collective. We have plans to publicly share some of these letters, responding to and riffing off of each other's letters as part of our own writing practices.

The pen pal exchange has been a fruitful experiment and we want to share it with our broader networks. More to come soon.

To summarize, I would be thrilled to join your team. I think I have a lot I can contribute, I play well with others, and I want to build quality, elegant, and helpful products with good people.

Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit more about me and how my piece might fit into the Tailwind puzzle. Please reach out of you have any questions or need more information.

I'll leave you with these little bits.
