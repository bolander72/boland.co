As a kid, I loved making things with Legos.

Now as an adult, I enjoy making things with code. This usually involves designing and developing digital products. Occasionally, it is making art, writing, or photography.

## About

My recent work has been as a startup founder, software engineer, and freelance creative. Before working independently, I created and sold a startup with co-founders, worked at new startups and Fortune 500 companies, and served as a creative consultant. Prior to that, I did a stint as an EiR with SwissContact.

I studied psychology and design in graduate school at the University of Brighton, UK. During that time, I served as a researcher to design agencies and later partnered with The New Digital School in Porto, Portugal as a RiR.

## Freelancing

I enjoy working with both early-stage startups and larger companies across industries. Extra points if you're working on AI, social, or Bitcoin projects. I also mentor for design and engineering at [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/michael-boland).

Some teams I've worked with include: [Carry](https://carry.com), [AE Studio](https://ae.studio), [Corteva](https://corteva.com), & [Hy-Vee](https://hy-vee.com).
