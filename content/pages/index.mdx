I'm a programmer, designer, and consultant.

I studied research psychology, HCI, and design in the UK while pivoting into a career in tech.

I think a lot about incentive systems, protocol design and development, and human ingenuity.

I currently work with small teams and startups building applications in generative AI, Bitcoin, fintech, and social media.
