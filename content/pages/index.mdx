As a kid, I loved making things with Legos.

Now as an adult, I enjoy making things with code. This usually involves designing and developing digital products. Occasionally, it is making art, writing, or photography.

## About

My recent work has been as a startup founder, software engineer, and freelance consultant. Before working independently, I created and sold a startup with co-founders, worked at new startups and Fortune 500 companies, and served as a UX designer and researcher. Prior to that, I did a stint as an EiR with Swiss EP.

I studied psychology and design in graduate school at the University of Brighton, UK. During that time, I worked as a researcher at design agencies and later partnered with The New Digital School in Porto, Portugal as a RiR.

## Work

I enjoy working with both early-stage startups and larger companies across industries. I also mentor designers and developers at [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/michael-boland).

Some teams I've worked with include: [Carry](/work#carry), [AE Studio](/work#ae%20studio), [Corteva](/work#corteva), & [Hy-Vee](/work#hy-vee).
