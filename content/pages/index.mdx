# Hello, I'm Michael.

I like to design and make things.

I studied research psychology, HCI, and design in the UK while pivoting into a career in tech.

I think a lot about incentive systems, protocol design and development, and human ingenuity.

I currently work with small teams and startups building applications across multiple industries and niches.
