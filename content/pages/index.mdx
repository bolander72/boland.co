I'm a [programmer](https://github.com/bolander72) and [consultant](https://linkedin.com/in/bolander72).\
Welcome to my corner of the internet.

{/* I build applications across web and mobile, do contract work for various clients, (co-)found startups, and tinker on various side projects.

In my consulting practice, I partner with startup founders and teams. I do my best work providing narrative and product strategy, helping define engineering processes, and advising on organizational design.

Here's what I'm up to [now](/now).
