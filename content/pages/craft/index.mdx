**I develop easy-to-use, performant, and scalable apps and websites for startups.**

Applications that work seamlessly from sign up to sign out, allowing your product to grow and mature alonside your business, user base, and visitors. If this is something you're interested in, you can book an intro call [here](https://cal.com/bolander72/chat) or reach out on X [here](https://x.com/bolander72).

I've built marketing pages and conference sites for companies like [Carry](https://carry.com), AI and crypto applications for teams like [Mainline](https://getmainline.io), and open-source research platforms for organizations like [Bitcoin Layers](https://bitcoinlayers.org). I've also worked with companies of all sizes in e-commerce, education, agtech, fintech, and other industries.

**I'm also open to other kinds of startup work**, including product strategy, technical architecting, and organizational design. If you need support envisioning and prioritizing your product roadmap, choosing an appropriate tech stack and infra pipeline, or organizing your team(s) and leadership processes, I have experience here too.

I consider myself a generalist at heart. Yes, there are others who go deeper in various aspects of _specific_ product and technical elements. Specialists are great and definitely needed. However, I do my best work working with the entire product lifecycle, from idea to "we're live."

{/* **You should probably not hire me if you're**:
- Seeking the cheapest work or hoping to conduct salary arbitrage
- Planning to treat me as a subordinate rather than partner
- Needing a code mess cleaned up (colloquially, plumbing)
- Only offering equity compensation */}
