**I develop easy-to-use, performant, and scalable apps and websites for startups.**

Applications that work seamlessly from sign up to sign out, allowing your product to grow and mature alonside your business, user base, and visitors. If this is something you're interested in, you can book an intro call [here](https://cal.com/bolander72/chat) or reach out on X [here](https://x.com/bolander72).

I've built marketing pages and conference sites for companies like [Carry](https://carry.com), AI and crypto applications for teams like [Mainline](https://getmainline.io), and open-source research platforms for organizations like [Bitcoin Layers](https://bitcoinlayers.org). I've also worked with companies of all sizes in e-commerce, education, agtech, fintech, and other industries.

**I'm also open to other kinds of startup work**, including product strategy, technical architecting, and organizational design. If you need support envisioning and prioritizing your product roadmap, choosing an appropriate tech stack and infra pipeline, or organizing your team(s) and leadership processes, I have experience here too.

I consider myself a generalist at heart. Yes, there are others who go deeper in various aspects of _specific_ product and technical elements. Specialists are great and definitely needed. However, I do my best work working with the entire product lifecycle, from idea to "we're live."

On generalists:

<blockquote>
  The generalist should bring to decision-making a healthy common sense. He must not
  cut himself off from the broad sweep of what is happening in his universe. He
  must remain capable of saying: "There's no real mystery about this at the
  moment. This is what we want now. It may prove wrong later, but we'll correct
  that when we come to it." The generalist must understand that anything we can
  identify as our universe is merely part of a larger phenomena. The generalist
  looks outward; he looks for living principles, knowing full well that such
  principles change, that they develop.

The goal is to help guide your company, team, product, and individual features given the best understanding of our industry _now_, knowing full-well that we will need to grow in a healthy, scalable, and sustainanle manner for whatever the future may hold.

I am very fortunate to have _many_ specialists in my network whom I can call on at any time to get a second opinion or expertise. I value their contributions tremendously.

**You should probably not hire me if you're**:

- Seeking the cheapest work or hoping to conduct salary arbitrage
- Planning to treat me as a subordinate rather than partner
- Needing a code mess cleaned up (colloquially, plumbing)
- Only offering equity compensation
