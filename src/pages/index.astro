                    I help teams figure out what to build, why it's worth
                    building, and how to turn ideas into something real. I also
                    build AI assistants and workflows for businesses that want
                    to stop doing repetitive work manually.

                    My work sits between technology, design, and the human side
                    of how people actually use and experience products. I tend
                    to gravitate toward early-stage or messy situations where
                    the path isn't obvious yet and someone needs to help make
                    sense of it. I've spent time across design, product,
                    software, and research, which mostly just means I like
                    looking at problems from a few different angles.
                </p>

                    I'm especially drawn to AI, fintech, and bitcoin, and to
                    products where trust, incentives, and interface choices have
                    real consequences. I care about how tools shape behavior
                    over time and how good design can help people make clearer,
                    more confident decisions.

                    Day to day, that often looks like talking with founders,
                    pressure-testing ideas, building small prototypes, and
                    writing to think things through. I like working with people
                    who are curious, who care about craft, and who want to build
                    things that still make sense years from now.
