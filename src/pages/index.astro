                    I help teams figure out what to build, why it matters, and
                    how to make it real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work at the intersection of technology, design, and human
                    systems, usually in early-stage, ambiguous environments
                    where direction matters more than velocity. My background
                    spans design, product, software, and research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m especially interested in AI systems, fintech and
                    bitcoin, and tools where trust, incentives, and interface
                    decisions shape real outcomes for people. I like work that
                    pays attention to how products influence behavior over time
                    and how thoughtful design can support better judgment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In practice, this usually means spending time with founders
                    and small teams, clarifying ideas, building prototypes to
                    explore concepts, and writing to sharpen thinking. I enjoy
                    environments where curiosity, care, and craft are valued,
                    and where people are serious about building things that hold
                    up over time.
