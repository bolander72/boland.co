                <p>The social contract is dead. Zoom calls in coffee shops, music aloud on the subway, texting in movie theaters, toes out on airplanes, etc. Everyone has "main character energy" now and thinks the rest of the world is a bunch of NPCs. The more you stare at a screen, the more you feel like you can do anything you want IRL since other humans just wind up seeming like avatars you can ignore, comments you can mute, or gang members you can run over in Grand Theft Auto.</p>

Participants should be forced to raise a barn together, not stand together in a beer garden. Conferences should take place over grueling 3 day hikes, season harvests, and small boat crossings.

                <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For many, corporate life is a velvet prison. It gives you comfortâ€”insurance, stabilityâ€”but at the cost of your soul. It grinds down ambition, boldness, &amp; originality until all that's left is someone who knows how to play the game, follow the rules, &amp; never rock the boat.
                </p>
                <p>Every lesson I've learned in a big company has been a lesson in how to maintain the status quo, which is the exact opposite of what's needed to make progress. These companies don't reward excellence or courageâ€”they reward people who are average across the board: non-threatening, obedient, & forgettable. Worse, they actively punish boldness. Boldness is risk, & risk is an allergy to the corporate ecosystem.</p>
